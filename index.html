              <h2>Hey Willy!</h2>
              <p>Bill French here, a.k.a. Willy, depending on whom you speak with. I moved from San Francisco to New York with my pal Gordon Shumway (pictured left) in October of 2010. We've since gone our separate ways but I still hear from him from time to time. He met up with some of his other buddies from Melmac and they started a food truck in Brooklyn or something. I think they park in the Dumbo lot sometimes but I can't remember what it's called.</p>
              <p>I'm a developer at <a href="http://hugeinc.com/">Huge</a>, a company that does excellent work.</p>
